# Dotfiles

A simple start for my environment. Currently, installs nvim with my plugins and `asdf` with Ruby and Node, plus yarn.

## installs
If required, manually install the following:
1. `nvim` should be installed via their package from Github and put in the `opt/` folder
2. `fzf` should be installed via a local git repository and running the install script.
